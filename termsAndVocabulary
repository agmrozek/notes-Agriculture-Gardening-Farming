1) FUNDAMENTAL GARDENING AND AGRICULTURE DEFINITIONS
########################################################

-----------------
1.1) Agriculture:
-----------------
The science and practice of farming and large crop cultivation including 
the rearing of animals to provide food and other products. The science of 
agriculture is now a staple of most major colleges and universities. 

---------------------
1.2) Amend/Amendment:
---------------------
To add materials such as fertilizer, compost, or other soil components to 
existing land in order to create a more nutrient rich or beneficial environment 
for plant growth. Some of the most popular types of soil amendments are perlite, 
vermiculite, coconut coir, and worm castings.

-------------
1.3) Compost:
-------------
A humus-like byproduct form organic matter decomposing that is rich in nutrients, 
typically improved by adding red worms for composting to aid in decomposition. 
Compost is extremely valuable in gardens because it not only adds nutrients, 
it improves the structure of your soil. By incorporating more organic matter, 
that moist and fluffy dark matter to your soil, you allow for better moisture 
retention and water drainage as pore space is increased. Without adequate pore 
space your water doesn't seep deep into the soil allowing for strong root growth. 
You can even run into problems with root rot because there is too much water sitting 
in the root region. You also want to have moist soil so your plants don't dry out. 
Compost also encourages healthy microbial activity suppressing soil borne diseases. 
A healthy soil is the basis for all organic growing endeavors as you create the most 
desirable conditions for your plants.

1.4) Regenerative:
------------------
Often used by those who want to save the world as a form of agriculture, regenerative 
means recovering the energy balance between the sun and our own bodies. We must realize 
that we evolved in the balance; precisely, and with high fidelity. These high fidelity 
genes function so well that organisms, when working in community and together, can safely 
push the evolutionary envelope. Regenerative is finding a way to move light through plants 
into the soil. The molecules that are generated in the process that would be good to focus 
on are what are known as root exudates. They grant nourishment to fungal and microbial colonies. 
I conclude that part by saying all these facts together, and operating on it from that single 
source of truth, will change the world. I can argue this position from a highly religious 
perspective as well, by claiming that the "good" spoken about in Genesis made perfect balance 
such that all life on Earth was spawned from it. Regenerative uses all modern technology that 
does not adversely effect the production of healthy proteins within our own cells. 
The contra-positive is true of highly processed substances, sometimes referred to as food. 
Regenerative practices would remove candy from floor height for instance. Now that I have 
everyone's irritation level up, let's examine the negative inflammatory effect of fructose 
in the liver of a child. This happens in a dose dependent manner, such that people who may be 
genetically predisposed to damage from fructose bare the greatest loss. Recovery is the first 
step to regenerative because regenerative does not work alone, and there is no way to get people 
to work with you if you are damaged.

1.5) Ecology:
-------------------
Ecology is the scientific study of the relationships between living organisms and their environment,
including the interactions between different species and between species and their physical surroundings. 
It encompasses the study of the distribution, abundance, and behavior of organisms, as well as the dynamics 
of their interactions with one another and with the physical and chemical features of their environment. 
Ecology is a broad field that encompasses a range of subdisciplines, including evolutionary ecology, 
population ecology, community ecology, and ecosystem ecology, among others. It is an important field of 
study that has implications for understanding the natural world and for addressing environmental issues 
and challenges faced by humans.
